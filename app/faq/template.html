		<h4>What is Content Syndication?</h4>
		<p>Content syndication provides a way for .....[domain]..... web pages to be placed onto your site. The syndicated content is automatically updated in real-time requiring no effort from your development staff to keep the pages up to date. You can present CDC web content in the look and feel of your Web site and maintain visitors on your site. Content syndication allows you to integrate CDC web content and science with localized content. You can also display CDC health messages directly to employees through your intranet.</p>

		<h4>How does it work?</h4>
		<p>CDC provides an application programming interface (API) that enables you to display .....[domain]..... content on your Web site by simply adding a JavaScript widget to your site that retrieves the CDC content. CDC assigns a unique campaign ID to you that is used for tracking and metrics purposes. This unique ID allows CDC to measure not only the traffic generated on your site, but also all traffic from your site back to .....[domain]......</p>

		<h4>Why is CDC doing this?</h4>
		<p>To disseminate up-to-date, accurate and timely health messages to our partners and the general public, and increase awareness of and exposure to our health-related partners' Web sites.</p>

		<h4>Why should you do this?</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>You gain direct access to CDC Web content without having to monitor and copy updates.</li>

		</ul>

		<h4>What if I don’t see the page I’m interested in syndicating?</h4>

		<h4>Is it possible to input syndicated content into a Sharepoint webpage if Sharepoint has the HTML editor disabled?</h4>
		<p>Unfortunately not. Currently, there is no way to embed the specific HTML script fragments for this purpose into Sharepoint.</p>
